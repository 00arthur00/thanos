and storing old blocks in bucket

Flags:
  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try
                                 --help-long and --help-man).

                                 to. If empty, tracing will be disabled.
      --gcloudtrace.sample-factor=1  
                                 How often we send traces (1/<sample-factor>).
                                 If 0 no trace will be sent periodically, unless
                                 forced by baggage item. See
                                 `pkg/tracing/tracing.go` for details.

                                 (StoreAPI). Make sure this address is routable
                                 from other components if you use gossip,
                                 'grpc-advertise-address' is empty and you
                                 require cross-node connection.
      --grpc-advertise-address=GRPC-ADVERTISE-ADDRESS

                                 If empty, 'grpc-address' will be used.
      --grpc-server-tls-cert=""  TLS Certificate for gRPC server, leave blank to
                                 disable TLS
      --grpc-server-tls-key=""   TLS Key for the gRPC server, leave blank to
                                 disable TLS
      --grpc-server-tls-client-ca=""  
                                 TLS CA to verify clients against. If no client
                                 CA is specified, there is no client
                                 verification on server side. (tls.NoClientCert)
      --http-address="0.0.0.0:10902"

      --cluster.advertise-address=CLUSTER.ADVERTISE-ADDRESS  
                                 Explicit (external) ip:port address to
                                 advertise for gossip in gossip cluster. Used
                                 internally for membership only.
      --cluster.peers=CLUSTER.PEERS ...  
                                 Initial peers to join the cluster. It can be
                                 either <ip:port>, or <domain:port>. A lookup
                                 resolution is done only at the startup.
      --cluster.gossip-interval=<gossip interval>  
                                 Interval between sending gossip messages. By
                                 lowering this value (more frequent) gossip
                                 messages are propagated across the cluster more
                                 quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth.
                                 Default is used from a specified network-type.
      --cluster.pushpull-interval=<push-pull interval>  
                                 Interval for gossip state syncs. Setting this
                                 interval lower (more frequent) will increase
                                 convergence speeds across larger clusters at
                                 the expense of increased bandwidth usage.
                                 Default is used from a specified network-type.
      --cluster.refresh-interval=1m  
                                 Interval for membership to refresh
                                 cluster.peers state, 0 disables refresh.
      --cluster.secret-key=CLUSTER.SECRET-KEY  
                                 Initial secret key to encrypt cluster gossip.
                                 Can be one of AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 in
                                 hexadecimal format.
      --cluster.network-type=lan  
                                 Network type with predefined peers
                                 configurations. Sets of configurations
                                 accounting the latency differences between
                                 network types: local, lan, wan.
      --label=<name>="<value>" ...  
                                 Labels to be applied to all generated metrics
                                 (repeated).
      --data-dir="data/"         data directory
      --rule-file=rules/ ...     Rule files that should be used by rule manager.
                                 Can be in glob format (repeated).
      --eval-interval=30s        The default evaluation interval to use.
      --tsdb.block-duration=2h   Block duration for TSDB block.
      --tsdb.retention=48h       Block retention time on local disk.
      --alertmanagers.url=ALERTMANAGERS.URL ...  
                                 Alertmanager URLs to push firing alerts to. The
                                 scheme may be prefixed with 'dns+' or 'dnssrv+'
                                 to detect Alertmanager IPs through respective
                                 DNS lookups. The port defaults to 9093 or the
                                 SRV record's value. The URL path is used as a
                                 prefix for the regular Alertmanager API path.
      --alert.query-url=ALERT.QUERY-URL  
                                 The external Thanos Query URL that would be set
                                 in all alerts 'Source' field
      --objstore.config-file=<bucket.config.path>  
                                 The object store configuration file path.
